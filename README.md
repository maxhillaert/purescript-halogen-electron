# purescript-halogen-electron

Exploring halogen/electron stack.   It's not clear whether there is space for a reusable abstraction for this stack. Halogen would simply live in the renderer process and communicate with a vanilla purescript main process via IPC, I'd imagine.

  I'm creating a project using that stack and will be putting anything reusable and useful in here, or close this repo if nothing comes out of it.

I've added a simple example to the code base anyway

Feel free to share ideas and contribute.
