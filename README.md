# purescript-halogen-electron

Exploring halogen/electron stack.   It's not clear whether there is space for a reusable abstraction for this stack.   I'm creating a project using that stack and will be putting anything reusable and useful in here, or close this repo if nothing comes out of it.

Feel free to share ideas and contribute.
